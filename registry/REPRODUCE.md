# How this repository was made (Bosnia and Herzegovina)

This file is written by the build on 2026-11-10, the day the source data was retrieved.

## Sources

| Source | Address | Retrieved | Licence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Službeni glasnik BiH (JP NIO Službeni list BiH, sluzbenilist.ba) | <https://www.sluzbenilist.ba/> | 2026-11-09 | Official texts of laws; not protected by copyright |

Every word of law in this repository comes from these sources. Lexifina reads them and records each act's dated versions, and the laws that made each change, in one corpus file. This repository is built from that file.

## What is in it

| Act | Title | Versions | Span |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| 1860 acts | every act, with its kind, number, status and span, is listed in [ACTS.md](ACTS.md) | 1897 | |

The build made 296 commits:

| Commits | Kind |
| ---: | --- |
| 296 | first version of an act |
| 0 | one law on its in-force day |
| 0 | changes no amendment note explains, credited to the publisher |

Other counts:
- 0 commits on the branch `future`: laws not yet in force on 2026-11-10.
- 0 commits dated 1 January 1970: in force before 1970, with the real day in their `In-force` trailer.
- 1866 laws in the record.
- 3804 tags.

## Dates

Each commit is dated at noon (Europe/Sarajevo) on the day the change took effect. The other dates, enacted and published, are trailers.

When a law gives no date of its own, the default rule applies: Each law of Bosnia and Herzegovina names its own day in its final article, almost always the eighth day after its publication in Službeni glasnik BiH; that day is used. https://www.sluzbenilist.ba/

## How the history is built

`tools/build/build.py` (and, for later publishes, `tools/build/append.py`) turns the corpus into this history in one pass: one commit per law, on the day it took effect. The same corpus always gives the same commit hashes. `tools/build/check_repo.py` reads every version back from git and compares it with the corpus. `tools/on.py` shows the law as it stood on any date. The corpus format is described in `tools/build/SCHEMA.md`.

- Corpus: sha256 `eb68da1eaf81ab97172a17bec9ef0daf043b5663a2a20b6b946a42158c1e10b2` (33970353 bytes).
- Builder blob hashes (`git hash-object`): `build.py` `0c3b59e094f64de681450174155d4a686e30cafb`, `check.py` `f7f9c39fff1b1f9a3aded2ad3364a27fb0908033`, `on.py` `0be88de7820b2dafe9f94fa40472a48776aa4cf5`.
- Python 3.12.10; git version 2.46.0.windows.1.

## Decisions made by hand

- Every act's decisions made by hand (390 in all) are listed in that act's own README.md, under "Decisions made by hand".

## What AI did and did not do

The scripts that read the sources and build this repository were written by Claude Code running Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`) under Lexifina's direction.

No model wrote, translated or corrected legal text. No model runs at build time. Every word of law in this repository comes from the official sources above.

The commit messages are written by `build.py` from the source data.

Model use at data-build time:
- none
